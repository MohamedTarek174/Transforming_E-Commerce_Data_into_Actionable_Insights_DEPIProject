# Transforming_E-Commerce_Data_into_Actionable_Insights_DEPIProject

This project aims to build a comprehensive data engineering and analytics pipeline to process e-commerce transactions and generate valuable business insights. Leveraging Azure Data Factory, an automated pipeline was designed to ingest data from CSV files into an Azure SQL database, where it was cleaned, transformed, and stored for further analysis. The pipeline facilitates efficient querying by merging SQL tables and applies regression analysis to predict sales trends. A Power BI dashboard was created to visualize key metrics and trends, allowing the team to present actionable insights for improving business decisions. The project demonstrates the integration of cloud-based tools and machine learning techniques to drive data-driven decision-making.
